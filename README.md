A hangman style game with a Tampa Bay Lightning twist.

## Tampa Bay Lightning Themed Hangman: How to Play

In this Tampa Bay Lightning themed hangman game, the user will press any letter to start the game. The game randomly selects a player from the players array and displays the length of their name as underscores and a corresponding image of the player as a hint. If a correct letter is guessed, the game will replace the underscore in the correct location of the players name. If a user chooses a letter not found in the players name, that letter will be added to the list of Wrong Letters Guessed. The amount of guesses a user has for each player's name is dependent on the length of the player's name. If the user doesn't guess the player's name in the specified number of guesses, the game resets and picks a new player to display. If the user guesses the player's name correctly, the user's wins increase by 1 and the game resets and picks a new player to display.
